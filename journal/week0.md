# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

### personal comment:
  Thank you for orgenazing and leading this bootcamp project and many thanks for accepting me to take part in it.
  
  I am totally new to the hands-on part of the cloud, so when comparing what I know and able to do today, compared to last week I can only be proud, but I must admit it is a big challenge. 
  
  As a lifelong fighter "I will do what ever it takes to make to the end successfully"! 
  
  ## Required homework
  
  ### Watching the videos:
  1. I watcched twice the live session and loved it! 
  2. I watched the billing video and created billing alarm and budget. I Did the relevant quiz.
  3. I Watched the security video, but I did have great dificulty to understand and follow along with the instructor. **I have an admin user**. Next step: I will find the time to watch it again or find an alternative resource for the subject. I did the relevant quiz.
