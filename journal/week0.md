# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

### personal comment:
  Thank you for orgenazing and leading this bootcamp project and many thanks for accepting me to take part in it.
  
  I am totally new to the hands-on part of the cloud, so when comparing what I know and able to do today, compared to last week I can only be proud, but I must admit it is a big challenge. 
  
  As a lifelong fighter "I will do what ever it takes to make to the end successfully"! 
  
  ## Required homework
  
  I managed to do all the required homework, but with great struggeling. 
  
  I am still having errors with the integration of Gitpod. I will give some deatails in the end of this journal page. 
  
  ### Watching the videos:
  1. I watcched twice the live session and loved it! 
  2. I watched the billing video and created billing alarm and budget. I Did the relevant quiz.
  3. I Watched the security video, but I did have great dificulty to understand and follow along with the instructor. **I have an admin user**. Next step: I will find the time to watch it again or find an alternative resource for the subject. I did the relevant quiz.

### Use CloudShell  
I managed to follow along and recreate the same result using CloudShell

## Problems i still have:

I am still having errors with the integration of Gitpod.

As you can see above I attached the screenshot of the implementation of AWS cli, but it does not update the gitpod.yml file.
The consequence of this error is that I need to redo the AWS cli instalation. 

Things i tried to do to resolve the issue. 
1. I tried to update the yml file from woithing GitHub but than when I try to reconnect to Gitpod i get this errer msg - Invalid gitpod.yml: should be array
2. I tried to follow along and redo the proccess more than once but i am getting the same result. 

I am sorry but I don't really know what else can I do.
